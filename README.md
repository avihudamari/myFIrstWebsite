# My first website!
welcome to my first website.

The wesite shows a list of cities from Israel on the right side and a map of the State of Israel on the left side.
Clicking on one of the cities will show severals markers pointing at different sites in the city.
In the mouse pointer over the markers, an info window appears with a small image and information about the place.

The wesite is written with HTML, CSS, javaScript and Google Maps API.
